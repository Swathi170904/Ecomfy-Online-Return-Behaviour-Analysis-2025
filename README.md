<h2>1. Business Understanding</h2>

<p>
The project began with understanding the business objective of analyzing sales performance and identifying patterns in product returns. The primary focus was to measure revenue loss and detect high-return products affecting profitability. This step helped define the key performance indicators required for analysis.
</p>

<br>

<h2>2. Data Extraction from SQL</h2>

<p>
The required dataset was extracted from a structured SQL database containing order details, product information, customer records, and return data. SQL queries were used to retrieve relevant tables necessary for analysis. The extracted data ensured consistency and reliability for further processing.
</p>

<br>

<h2>3. Data Import</h2>

<p>
The extracted data was imported into Power BI for visualization and analytical modeling. The import process ensured accurate loading of tables into the Power BI environment. This step prepared the dataset for cleaning and structured transformation.
</p>

<br>

<h2>4. Data Transformation</h2>

<p>
Data transformation was performed using Power Query to clean and structure the dataset properly. Missing values were handled, duplicates were removed, and incorrect data types were corrected. Structured tables were prepared to support accurate analysis and reporting.
</p>

<br>

<h2>5. Data Modeling</h2>

<p>
Relationships were established between multiple tables to build an optimized data model. DAX measures were created to calculate Return Percentage, Revenue Loss, Total Sales, and Monthly Trends. This modeling process enabled dynamic KPI calculations and interactive dashboard reporting.
</p>

<br>

<h2>6. Dashboard Development</h2>

<p>
An interactive dashboard was developed using KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and geographical maps. The visuals display category performance, product-level return insights, sales distribution, and time-based trends. The layout was designed to ensure clarity, usability, and business-focused storytelling.
</p>

<br>

<h2>7. Insight Generation</h2>

<p>
Business insights were derived to identify high-return products and underperforming categories. Revenue loss due to returns was evaluated to measure financial impact on overall sales. The findings support strategic decisions aimed at reducing returns and improving profitability.
